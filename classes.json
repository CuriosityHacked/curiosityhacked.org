This class is about how to make cool 3d stuff using 2d parts.  Kids will learn about making designs, choosing materials, joining parts (where your work first becomes 3D!) and fabrication.

In this course, we'll be learning about games as an art form, then using our knowledge and our imaginations to make a digital, physical, or hybrid/experimental game using any of the materials available to us at Curiosity Hacked. By the end of the course, students will have games to take home, critiquing skills, and a fresh perspective on the creative potential of games as a medium!

    Mentor Jodediah Holems is an award-winning game designer who loves weird, experimental, and artsy creations. They believe that games are as easy to make as any short story, homemade film, or colorful painting. Everyone can make games and everyone should! Games can be anything! ",

With knives we can create spears, atlatls, darts, throwing stars, and simple but effective traps and snares. Power tools offer us the ability to create wooden swords, axes, and shields. They aren't always pretty, but they are sturdy and fierce! The laser cutter utilizes more delicate wood, but allows for the creation of complex and fantastical weapon designs limited only by our imaginations. Children will also have the option to decorate and accessorize their weapons with paint, foam, leather, and more.",

The final six weeks will dive deeper into mentoring the kids in the areas of making that interest them most, resulting in a project of their own vision. This makes each session useful and accessible to every child, while also being different and customized to the group every time.
