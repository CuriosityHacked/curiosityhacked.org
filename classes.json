By the end of the course, students will have games to take home, critiquing skills, and a fresh perspective on the creative potential of games as a medium!<p>Mentor Jodediah Holems is an award-winning game designer who loves weird, experimental, and artsy creations. They believe that games are as easy to make as any short story, homemade film, or colorful painting. Everyone can make games and everyone should! Games can be anything! ",

With knives we can create spears, atlatls, darts, throwing stars, and simple but effective traps and snares. Power tools offer us the ability to create wooden swords, axes, and shields. They aren't always pretty, but they are sturdy and fierce! The laser cutter utilizes more delicate wood, but allows for the creation of complex and fantastical weapon designs limited only by our imaginations. Children will also have the option to decorate and accessorize their weapons with paint, foam, leather, and more.",
