        <span class='image image-right'><p><img src='images/binder.jpg' alt='' /> The
          Curiosity Hacked Guild is a weekly program for older children (8 and
          up) who are ready for more complex skill building and a focus on their
          individual goals while building relationships within a community. The program is
          <a href='structure.html'>designed</a> to balance between structure and autonomy,
          uniquely addressing the developmental, intellectual, and social needs of this
          age group. Some Guilds begin with the Hackerling Circuit project, which is an
          Arduino Shield (circuit board) that gives all of our young hackers a well rounded
          education in STEAM concepts and exposing them to the fundamentals of skills,
          resources, and ideas. Topics covered include circuit and hardware science and
          function, soldering, LEDs, sewing, design, laser cutting, and more.Not only does
          this project give our kids a strong foundation to work from, but it also allows
          them the opportunity to make autonomous decisions around their own interests and
          what badges they may want to pursue later on. In our Guilds, kids pursue badges based on their own interests, invest themselves in smaller projects, and/or work on group projects. Mentorship plays a crucial role in our Guilds, both from experts to learners and peer to peer, offering a variety of opportunities for exploration and sharing of skills and knowledge. Every meeting also includes exposure to our core values, provoking thought and discussion.  Meetings can also include field trips that offer an opportunity to try new skills and explore ideas.
Every meeting also includes
          exposure to our <a
          href='values.html'>core values</a> that provokes thought and discussion. Once members complete the Hackerling Circuit
          Badge, members split into smaller crews to pursue Badges or focus on projects in the
          areas of their own interest. Meeting also include group projects and field trips
          that offer an opportunity to try new skills and explore ideas.</p></span>
