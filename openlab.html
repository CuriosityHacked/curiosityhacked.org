  											/>Open Lab is an all ages program based on how children learn through
  											various developmental and educational theories as well as a desire we
  											see in the Maker culture for community and family inclusiveness.  The
  											idea is this: Twice a month we hold Open Labs where we have
  											experts/mentors available to help kids with any project they bring in.
  											There is also a featured project that a whole workshop is built around
  											that specifically targets skill building. In addition, there is always a
  											menu of other kits/activities that are available for kids that focus on
  											a variety of interests, skills, and ways of learning. The structure has
  											a method- it creates consistency and the opportunity for mentoring and
  											improvement, the provided activities and featured workshops are designed
  											to teach to multiple learning styles, the format supports autonomy and
  											independence, and the program is inclusive and adaptable. Kids can earn
  											badges or not for their skill building, and they can come every week or
  											once in a while. The result is exceptional and exciting- families have
  											come and learned, shared, hacked and formed community in our hackerspace
  											while thriving on the opportunity to learn new skills, reinforce
  											knowledge, and benefit from mentoring to explore their own interests and
  											achieve their unique goals. </p></span>
