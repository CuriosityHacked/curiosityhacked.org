##Birthday Parties at Curiosity Hacked Oakland Lab!

Celebrate a birthday or other special occasion with a hands-on experience at the Curiosity Hacked Oakland Lab! Choose from our menu of activities below, or let us know if your child has a particular passion and we’ll design the perfect activity! We encourage you to plan ahead, as time slots fill up fast!



*Includes:* 2 hours of guided exploration and making with a Curiosity Hacked Mentor for up to 15 kids, plus time in the space for snacks and cake. All kids will take home a finished project! Cost: $375 ($10 per extra child) 

###Activities

Examples of Activities include Hydraulic Judo Bots, Electronics, E-Textiles, Printmaking, Mouse Trap Race Cars or Crash Test Cars, Treasure Chests, Brush Bots and Habitats and more.

We always create a project designed specifically for and with the birthday kid! From a Frozen fan who wanted to make ice castles to robotic big cats inspired by a kid’s passion for cheetahs and leopards, we can hack up a project to fulfill any vision!
