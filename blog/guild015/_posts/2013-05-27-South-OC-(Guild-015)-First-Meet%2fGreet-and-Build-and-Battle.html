<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">What an awesome first meet and greet and an epic build and battle for HSSOC Guild 015 last Saturday (May 25) was! We had a 100% turnout with a waitlist. A member even mentioned she has at least 15 more friends who are interested but did not sign-up anymore because they knew our Guild was maxed out at 20 participants for this meeting. It is looking like pretty soon, we will have enough interest to form a Sunday and weekday meeting as well as another guild just in the South OC alone. &nbsp;The Hacker Scouts movement has definitely reached this part of the country and we anticipate a whole lot of making, creating, designing, innovating, hacking, and learning adventures with more families soon.<br /><br />Thank you everyone for a wonderful afternoon. All the hardwork to make this happen definitely paid off. We look forward to the next activity! Special thanks to guild co-leaders Amy and Chris for all your help plus everyone who assisted the kids in the build. A lot of the Dads said choosing a 5 out 5 in difficulty project was definitely a challenge and that they look forward to the next projects! Thanks, too to co-member Dawn for getting us a free space at Michael&#39;s for this meeting at such a short notice.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">Please don&#39;t forget to take videos of your judobots.
