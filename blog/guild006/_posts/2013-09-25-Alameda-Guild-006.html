title: "Alameda Guild 006"
---
<p>Hi All,</p><p>We&#39;ve been a little quiet here but Guild 006 in Alameda has started its first crew, the Hacker Source Force. There are 17 children ages 8 through 12 in the crew. The HCF&#39;s first project is to complete a &quot;Learn to Solder&quot; practice kit from Elenco. The kit features a soldering practice area on the circuit board. Once that is complete the children will attach components as per instructions. The end result will be a European type siren complete with flashing LEDs. We chose this kit as a precursor to the Hackerling Shield to give the kids the opportunity to learn the skill before Shield work. The kit seems to be appropriately challenging for a first project. Upon completion the kids will have earned their soldering badge.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the project the kids are learning basic electronics. Discussions have included Ohm&#39;s Law and the principals on how resistors and electronic switches work. Capacitors were discussed this week. Next week we will discuss transistors. The sessions go quickly and all the kids are accomplishing a lot. The quality of work being turned in is great.&nbsp;</p><p>Paul Skuta<br />Guild 006 Guild Leader</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
