title: "Hacker Scouts launches a Kickstarter!"
---
<p>It has been our dream from the beginning to open a space designed for kids and their families, and it is now becoming a reality! In order to meet the demand for our programs and expand what we can do for both our local and national community, we are opening a space in North Oakland.&nbsp;</p><p>For the past year, we have been partnered with a hackerspace- Ace Monster Toys- and they have been amazing and supportive. We will continue that relationship but this new space is essential to our growth!</p><h4>We need your help to make this happen! Please consider donating to our <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/832476585/hacker-scouts-oakland-lab">Kickstarter</a> and sharing our story with your community!</h4><p>Remember, this space not only serves the Bay Area, but benefits our global partners through all the open source programs and activities we design and distribute. Thanks so much for your support!</p><p>http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/832476585/hacker-scouts-oakland-lab</p>
