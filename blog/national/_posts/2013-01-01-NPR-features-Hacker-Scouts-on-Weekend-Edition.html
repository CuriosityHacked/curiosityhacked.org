In September, AMT’s youth program <a href="http://hackerscouts.acemonstertoys.org/" target="_blank">Hacker Scouts</a> was honored to host NPR reporter <a href="http://jonkalish.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Jon Kalish</a> at one of our Open Labs. Since he focuses on the DIY movement, Mr. Kalish was curious about how we were serving the next generation of Makers.  He seemed particularly interested in our approach of hands-on skill building and the importance we place on autonomy and choice. He observed and interviewed parents and kids, and finally we get to hear the result!

His story about the Hacker Scouts, the web site <a href="http://diy.org/" target="_blank">diy.org</a> and merit badges for young makers was feature on NPR's Weekend Edition on December 23rd, 2012. You can listen to it <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/12/23/167285991/with-growth-of-hacker-scouting-more-kids-learn-to-tinker?guid=1356318556716#commentBlock">here</a>.

We had an enormous response from our feature on NPR's Weekend Edition! It means so much to us that what we are doing resonates with so many! We appreciate all the kind words and support of relevant and real STEAM education!
