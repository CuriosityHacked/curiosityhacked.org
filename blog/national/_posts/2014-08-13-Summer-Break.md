**Curiosity Hacked** is a national non profit organization, founded in the Fall of 2012 in Oakland CA, that focuses on STEAM (_science, technology, engineering, art, and math_) education, skill building and community engagement with the aspiration to help our children develop skills in the areas they are truly interested in, abilities that would allow them to dream big and create big.
