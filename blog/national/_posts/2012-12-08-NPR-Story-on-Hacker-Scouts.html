title: "NPR Story on Hacker Scouts!"

<img src='/media/Blog/photo-1-e1354998740527-225x300.jpg' height='225' width='300'>In September, AMT's youth program <a href="http://hackerscouts.acemonstertoys.org/" target="_blank">Hacker Scouts</a> was honored to host NPR reporter <a href="http://jonkalish.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Jon Kalish</a> at one of our Open Labs. Since he focuses on the DIY movement, Mr. Kalish was curious about how we were serving the next generation of Makers.  He seemed particularly interested in our approach of hands-on skill building and the importance we place on autonomy and choice. He observed and interviewed parents and kids, and finally we get to hear the result!

His story about the Hacker Scouts, the web site <a href="http://diy.org/" target="_blank">diy.org</a> and merit badges for young makers will air on "Spark" this weekend. Listen here:
