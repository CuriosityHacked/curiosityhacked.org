<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">On the weekend of 8/9-12 2013, we managed to pull together our first multi-Guild event! Bay Area Scouts were joined by kids and mentors from Guild 005 (Las Vegas New Mexico). Sight seeing, a tour of the Exploratorium, an Open Lab, and a party made this a memorable occasion! We can&#39;t wait to do it again next year with more Guilds! It was awesome to see how quickly the kids bonded over similar interests, and HackerTogether ended with hugs and the exchanging of emails and Skype Names! Special thanks to Mariano and Guild 005 for flying out here and having fun with us!</span></p><p><img src='/media/Blog/HT2013.jpg' height='480' width='359'></p>
