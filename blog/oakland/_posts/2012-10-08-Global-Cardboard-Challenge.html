We were one of over 200 events in over 30 countries and the kids definitely felt connected to the idea and the point of the challenge! We had games and cockpits, costumes and body armour, all very personal designs that reflected the builder.

We also built more compressed air rockets (extra hero credit to the dads who climbed trees to rescue wind blown rockets!), some of the older kids took on the challenge of the more complex soldering kits, and the laser cut dinosaur puzzles were very popular! We also debuted our Sewing project 2.0, in which kids took felt fabric down to our mentor Shosanna and laser cut a design and then took the cut fabric back up to sewing expert Crafty to create monster plushies. They were simply exquisite.<a href="/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/IMG_2084.jpg"><img src='/media/Blog/IMG_2084-225x300.jpg' height='225' width='300'></a>

It was a quieter day than usual, something we expected given the 3 million things going on in our area this weekend! That said, we still had over 30 kids and plenty do work on!

Coming up next Sunday (10/14), we will have a display at the Ace Monster Toys booth at the East Bay Mini Maker Faire. If you are attending, stop by and say hello!

The following Sunday (10/21) will be our next Hacker Scouts Open Lab. Our featured project will be Trebuchets and our Activities menu will also include Day Of the Dead tin pocket altars, Day of the Dead laser cut lanterns, and Sewing: Trick or Treat bags. We will also have an assortment of soldering kits, a few Judo Bot kits for those who missed it, and as usual kids are always welcome to bring their own projects and make use of our fantastic mentors.
