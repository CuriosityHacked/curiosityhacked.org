<strong>12/16 Open Lab Follow-Up:</strong>

Wow! Wow! Great Hacker Scouts today! I was a bit taken by surprise that Needle Felting outsold every other activity we offered. Who knew?! But it was awesome- boys and girls making all kinds of animals and characters. One of my favorites: A super hero kitty that had disguises hidden under her cape that would change her appearance into a dog or a bunny. SO clever, these kiddos! They have begged me to bring Needle Felting back, and so I shall. How is needle felting hacking? Well, it is modifying wool to make it into whatever you want! (Not to mention, it is great for those fine motor skills!) But there was also some very cool battery making, linocut,  and LED pop-up card making as well, plus electronic kits, which made another well-rounded Open lab. Here's some pics I managed to shoot:
