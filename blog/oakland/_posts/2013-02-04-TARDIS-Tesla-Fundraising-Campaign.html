title: "TARDIS Tesla Fundraising Campaign"
---
<p>Cameron is one of our amazing Hacker Scouts and he has big plans for the Maker Faire this year! &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>He is a 17 year old, homeschooled guy&nbsp;that paints, plays with lightning, makes electronic mechanical contraptions, writes computer programs, and builds/fixes computers.</p><p>The Project:</p><p><a href="http://www.gofundme.com/TARDIS-Tesla" target="_blank">TARDIS Tesla</a> is an electric performance/game involving two large tesla coils, a replica TARDIS, and sonic screwdriver TV remotes. The way it works is there are two players each with a sonic screwdriver that they use to play a game of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_cows" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bulls and Cows</a>&nbsp;These sonic screwdrivers have accelerometers in them that detects movement like up, down, left, right, ect. The players move their screwdriver to input a sequence of commands assigned to each movement. Each screwdriver has a corresponding coil it controls via a computer program and arduinos. The Two Players (or companions) demonstrate their ability to use a sonic screwdriver to gain access to the TARDIS. Whenever they enter in part of the combo, their corresponding coil fires a bolt of lightning at the TARDIS. If it&#39;s correct, the bolt sounds like a sonic screwdriver and if it&#39;s incorrect sounds like an error beep. Who ever wins gets to pick a song to play on the coils.</p><p>From the Hacker Scouts Team:</p><p>We are proud to be helping Cam reach his Maker Faire goal.
