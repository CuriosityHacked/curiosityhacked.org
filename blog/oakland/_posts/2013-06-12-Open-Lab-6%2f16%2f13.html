Participants will use craft sticks, plastic wheels, hot glue, and more to build a car that can keep a hard-boiled egg safe in the event of a crash. Crashes are simulated by rolling the cars down a ramp and into a wall, or into another car. Makers will be able to use weighted plastic eggs as &quot;crash test dummies&quot; to test their cars before trying it out on a real egg. Very open ended, exciting, and easy to jump in and build!
