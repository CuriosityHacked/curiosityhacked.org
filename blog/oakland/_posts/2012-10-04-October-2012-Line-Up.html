light start to change as we move into October!So we have a stellar line-up for Hacker Scouts in October, with a few
changes. First, as of writing this, we are still waiting on parts for the
Spy Gadgets. We sourced the parts from overseas to keep the price as low as
possible but sometimes the shipping process is not an exact match to the
estimated delivery date. We thought about giving it a few more days before
making a decision, but then another opportunity arose that we are really
excited about. We are moving Spy Gadgets to the 11/4 Hacker Scouts Open lab
so that we can participate in the Global Cardboard Challenge on 10/7. This
idea was designed by the Imagination Foundation, inspired by the ingenuity
and creativity of Caine's Arcade. (See more about the event here:
<a href="http://www.imagination.is/" target="_blank">http://www.imagination.is/</a>) We saw this as a great chance to have the kids
work in teams on an open-ended project together, as well as a fun way to
interact as a community. Our own kids loved the video of Caine's Arcade and
are very excited to develop their own games! The Cardboard Challenge will
be free of charge. We will also have other activity kits available, as well
as access to the Laser Cutter, a sewing project, and Compressed Air Rockets
(The kids begged me to bring it again!)On Sunday, October 14, AMT will have a table at the Mini Maker Faire,
featuring an entire display on the Hacker Scouts program. Please come visit
us and say hello!

On October 21, our featured project will be Trebuchets. We just received
these in the mail today and the kits are amazing! Note- while we try to
keep all featured projects under $10, this one is an exception. The company
we ordered from gave us an great deal, but the cost will be $20 and we have
25 of them. During that Hacker Scouts lab we will also have a variety of
Activity Kits, access to the Laser Cutter, Sewing Trick or Treat Bags, and
Mini Tin Dias De Los Muertos pocket altars. As always, kids are welcome to
bring their own project to work on and/or get help with at any Open Lab.

Also, we will be unveiling our badge program in October! We have Hacker
Scout badges being made right now, and will have a selection on hand for
kids to choose from such as "Learn To Solder" and Drawdio." What, you might
ask, do we put the badges on? Well, you could put them on a hat or a
backpack! OR you could purchase one of our stylish canvas tool belts that a
focus group of Hacker Scouts selected as the most awesome and useful thing
to put their badges on ever.

Finally, we encourage you to let us know if there are ever any kits or
activities that you would like to see Hacker Scouts offer. We get a great
discount at many online sources (that we pass along to you!) and have a
fantastic variety of skills among our mentors, and we are always looking to
serve our fellow Hacker families better. Thanks for all your support
and encouragement as we build this beautiful community.

In Making we trust, Chris and Sam
