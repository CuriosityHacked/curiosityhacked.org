11/18/12 Open Lab Review:

Thanks to everyone who came out today for a great Open Lab! We had a blast exploring another method of projectiles: Extreme Rubber Band Guns. We sold out immediately of our laser cut kits, but we had many kids who actively chose to create their own rubber band guns and those versions were just as genius and fun! And those kids have excellent aim.

&#160;

Upstairs, we also enjoyed rolling seed bombs, marking the first time we have introduced a homesteading project in Open Lab. The kids loved making them, and the sensation of working with their hands in the clay and compost met a lot of sensory needs and motor skills practice. Everyone is looking forward to the color explosions from the seed bombs! We also had an adorable light-up plushie sewing project upstairs. Kids made their own little creatures that lit up using soft circuitry Â  and LEDs.

We received many emails from families telling us that they were traveling this week. Thanks for letting us know and may you have a wonderful Thanksgiving! We hope to see many of you at the next Open Lab on December 2nd!

Chris, Sam, and the Hacker Scouts Team
