The variety of presentations, the enthusiasm of the participants and the visitors, the creativity and ingenuity- it was all infectious!

Hacker Scouts participated by having a display at the Ace Monster Toys table, where we showed off some of the activities we have featured and guests could check out a Hydraulic Judo Bot, a BioSphere, and a Laser-Cut-then-Sewn Plushy in person. Kids and grownups alike also got to play the newly Halloween themed laser <a href="http://acemonstertoys.org/node/107">Shooting Gallery</a>.
