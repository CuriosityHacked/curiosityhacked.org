<p><strong>Featured project: Folding Wing Gliders!</strong> This is not your average balsa wood airplane. Originally designed by Jim Walker in the late 1930s, this glider has wings that fold back, allowing it to become more streamlined. This unique twist enables the glider to rocket 60 to 70 feet into the air using the included rubber band. At the peak of the climb the wings fold back out, allowing the glider to soar over long distances. There will be a group going to Golden Gate Playground a few blocks away (at San Pablo and 62nd St) towards the end of Open Lab, where there is a big field to let the gliders fly! ($10 material fee) Limit: 25 kids</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Best-Heart.jpg">[[{"type":"media","view_mode":"media_large","fid":"125","attributes":{"height":300,"width":224,"class":"media-image alignleft size-medium wp-image-542 media-element file-media-large"}}]]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Tesla Coils with CamDAX</strong> CamDAX is going to bring his Audio Modulated Tesla Coil, to play some&nbsp;awesome&nbsp;music, and shock him self as well as any willing&nbsp;victims. &nbsp;Also there will be a&nbsp;piano and electric&nbsp;guitar, so you can play your own tune on the coil.
