<h2>Join us for Oakland Open Lab this Sunday 11/17/13!&nbsp;</h2><h2>2-5pm at the Curiosity Hacked Oakland Lab: 6036 Telegraph Ave, Oakland</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Featured Projects:</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><img src='/media/Blog/raygun.png' height='220' width='175'>&nbsp; &nbsp;Vector Ray Guns</h3><p>Create a small, lo-fi electronic noisemaker circuit that makes classic, raygun sounds that are modifiable through three control knobs. Soldering will be required, options besides the gun shape will be available. Please note: this project is at a higher skill and focus level and more suitable for older kids or as a collaborative family project. (Limit 20, Material fee $20)</p><h3><img src='/media/Blog/puffballs_2.jpg' height='220' width='132'>&nbsp;<span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; white-space: pre-wrap; font-size: 13.333333969116211px; line-height: 1.15;">Puff Ball Project:</span></h3><p><br /><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px;"><span style="vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial;">We&rsquo;ll be making &ldquo;puff balls&rdquo;- spherical hanging creations upcycled from both old and new materials. These were first conceived for a coworking office space to function as both a ceiling art installation and sound absorbing material. Each puff ball will be unique, made of felt and yarn of contrasting color, thickness and texture. &nbsp;These are fun to make and all materials will be provided. (Materials fee: Free!)</span></span></p><h3>Soldering</h3><p>Learn to solder or work on your skills with one of our excellent electronic kits. (Material fees vary)</p><h2>Also, join us next Sunday 11/24 from 2-5pm for our Grand Opening Party! Food, demos, some fun activities. Come celebrate our new space with us!</h2>
