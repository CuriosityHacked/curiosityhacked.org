As we move through November, our family and all our volunteer mentors at AMT would like to express our gratitude for your encouragement and support as we build this program and community. There has been no greater gift than seeing the kids who come learn and marvel and explore with such enthusiasm and focus. As one kid said: "It's kinda cool to know there are other people who like to do this kind of stuff too. And to be around them." Indeed.

Happy Thanksgiving from all of us at Hacker Scouts.

<strong>Announcement: </strong>We will be holding an informational meeting for our now forming Hacker Scouts Guild (Troop) on Monday, November 19th 2012 at 7pm at AMT. This will be a chance for parents and kids to get to know our Guild leader Garratt, ask questions, and participate in a discussion around activities and goals. We hope to see you there!

RSVP's are appreciated but not mandatory. You can email us or let us know you are coming on our <a href="http://meetup.acemonstertoys.org/events/91256632/?eventId=91256632&amp;action=detail">MeetUp page</a>.

<strong></strong>This week at Open Lab we are continuing with the kids excitement and desire for projectiles by making Extreme Rubber Band Guns. We will have all the materials they need (cardboard, tubing, wood, tools, rubber bands, etc.) available for the kids to build their own rubber band guns though invention and improvisation. Examples will be given. For the kids who like to work with kits, we will have a limited number of laser cut Extreme Rubber Band Gun kits available.

Kits will be $10 each.

You can find amazing ingenuity, craft, and inspiration at <a href="http://oggcraft.jp/eng/eng_gun.html">OGG Craft.</a> There are video links on this site to see the rubber band guns in action!
