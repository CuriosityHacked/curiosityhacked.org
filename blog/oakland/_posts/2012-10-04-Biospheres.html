Yesterday marked the inaugural Open Lab for our new adventure: Hacker Scouts. We had an amazing turnout with about 40 enthusiastic kids and their supportive parents! Our featured project was <a href="http://makeprojects.com/Project/Tabletop-Biosphere/329/1#s1933">Biospheres</a> (also see <a href="http://science.kqed.org/quest/video/make-it-at-home-table-top-biosphere/">here</a>), which half the kids decided to work on, with the other half choosing activities from our menu, including a Learn to Solder Kit, Drawdio! Kit, a Plushy Sewing Project, Using the Laser Cutter to produce original designs, Laser Cut Dino Puzzles, and Kinetic Mobile Art.  There was also a fantastic Hex Bug village built. We had many mentors on hand from <a href="http://acemonstertoys.org/">AMT</a> and several parents who joined our team to assist the kids in building their skills. The format we designed worked well, with the featured project and kit instruction providing enough structure, but leaving the choice of what to work on, which skills to build, and the possibilities of their imagination firmly in the hands of the kids. There was a beautiful community spirit present, which is the point of this whole program. Making as a part of our everyday life and relationships rather than compartmentalizing it into simply a hobby.
