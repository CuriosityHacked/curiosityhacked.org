Well, yesterday was a great Open Lab! We had A LOT of different activities going on and a full house but the #1 rule of Hacker Scouts was certainly met: we had fun!

We began Open lab with a quick meeting of important discussion items:
<ul>
<li>A review of the three rules of Hacker Scouts: Have Fun, No Rough Housing, No Using the Equipment without an Adult Present.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Check-in on the BioSphere project: two kids reported their Biospheres are still alive and functioning. One kid said his shrimp was dead and now he calls it the Mort-osphere. hah!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In November, we will be starting a Hacker Scouts Troop, that will meet at AMT on a weekday evening. It's focus will be on STEM education, with the opportunity to work on longer-term projects, take interesting field trips, and create a more cohesive community around shared interests. Some of the activities will correlate with our Badge program (see next item), however whether or not to work for a badge will always remain the choice of the kid. This troop will be led by one of our dedicated mentors, Garratt, who is an Eagle Scout, member of AMT, and loves robots. More information to come soon!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We unveiled our Badge program today! Many children were excited about our new

Hacker Scouts badge, which you can get simply by coming to an Open Lab. Other badges will be earned by completing specific kits (like the Drawdio) or by testing knowledge, application and retention (like soldering or sewing). We will have the process for these badges posted on the website so kids can access them before an Open Lab. Kids who wish to test for a badge should sign up at the beginning of an Open Lab, and one of our mentors will call them over during the last hour of Open Lab.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Many parents seem interested in adding a discussion list to interact more as a community, so we will be adding that this week and sensing out the link to join.</li>
</ul>
Our featured project this week was Trebuchets, which quickly sold out. Our experiment in pre-sales seems to have helped relieve the lines to buy kits, so we will be offering that option again. We filled the woodshop and the halls at AMT, eventually producing lines of Trebuchets flinging their ammunition with force and style. The lanterns were also a great hit and many chose to add-on a the LED light kit, which expanded the skills covered to both laser cutting, different forms of assemblage. In other parts of AMT, awesome laser cut Trick or Treat bags were sewn and readied for loot while others carefully and delicately put together pocket altars to honor those who have gone before. And as usual there was a dedicated crowd around the soldering table.
