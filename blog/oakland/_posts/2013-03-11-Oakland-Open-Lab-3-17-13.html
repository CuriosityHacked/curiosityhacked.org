<h2>For St Patty&#39;s Day, Easter, and the Spring Equinox, we&#39;ve got a lucky line-up for Sunday&#39;s Open Lab!</h2><h2>Polymer Science and two ways to customize eggs!</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><img src='/media/Blog/Slime-Spangler-Halloween-Science-Win-25-Gallons1.jpg' height='166' width='220'>Featured project: Polymer Science!</h2><h3>Experience the fun and magic that is polymer science by making your own silly putty, slime, and weird jelly marble. Also learn how to do a nylon rope trick!</h3><h3>($8 materials fee)</h3><h3>More science fun! Add-on kit: Glow in the dark pen and UV flashlight. The UV flashlight makes the slime fluoresce! ($3 materials fee- limited to 15)</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><img src='/media/Blog/plaid_600.jpg' height='220' width='165'>&nbsp;Eggbot!&nbsp;</h2><h3>The Eggbot is an open-source art robot that can draw on spherical or egg shaped objects from the size of a ping pong ball to that of a small grapefruit! Come watch this amazing machine at work and design your own egg or ping pong ball!

($4 material fee)</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>See you on Sunday from 2-5pm!</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Summary:</h2><p>Wow! It was a busy and fun Open Lab in Oakland yesterday! We had around 50 kids learning about polymer science, the chemistry of plant dyes, the coolness of the Eggbot, and the satisfaction of successfully completing an electronic kit! We also enjoyed a lot of new families mixed in with familiar faces. Thanks to everyone who joined us for another wonderful Open Lab!</p><p>Some pics from the afternoon:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><img src='/media/Blog/IMG_3548.JPG' height='360' width='480'><img src='/media/Blog/IMG_3541.JPG' height='360' width='480'><img src='/media/Blog/IMG_3542.JPG' height='360' width='480'><img src='/media/Blog/47A03226-22AD-47C6-8543-CBF56937FE5B.jpeg' height='480' width='358'><img src='/media/Blog/IMG_3545.JPG' height='360' width='480'></h3><h2>&nbsp;</h2>
