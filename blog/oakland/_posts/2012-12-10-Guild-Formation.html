<p>Thank you all for your interest in Hacker Scouts! [[{"fid":"254","view_mode":"full","type":"media","attributes":{"height":200,"width":300,"style":"width: 300px; height: 200px; float: right;","class":"media-element file-full"}}]]</p><p>We had an overwhelming response to the Hacker Scouts Guild, which is wonderful, but it means we are going to have to split the group into halves, with one starting now and the&nbsp;other&nbsp;entering our Guild &nbsp;around late February.&nbsp;We decided that the fairest way to do this was to first ask anyone who is not 8 yet to wait until the next group comes in, and then add the families according to attendance and when we received registrations. We appreciate your understanding and patience.The idea is to make sure we have the ability to mentor each child in the way they deserve and move them through the hackerling circuit into their special interest crews. Then we will start a new crew of kids who will work on the hackerling circuit. Eventually they will also join the special interest crews, and we will be able to bring in another new group and so on. We will be mixing it all up with field trips and special projects along the way. &nbsp;We will keep the website updated so everyone can see how it is going and what the kids are up to. Often, this will be in their own voices since documentation is an important part of our program!</p><p>[[{"fid":"253","view_mode":"full","type":"media","attributes":{"height":480,"width":320,"style":"width: 273px; height: 410px; float: right;","class":"media-element file-full"}}]]If your child is interested in joining the Guild in the future, feel free to email us and we can put your family&#39;s name on the waiting list.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
