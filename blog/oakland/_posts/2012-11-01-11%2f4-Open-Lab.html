title: "11/4 Open Lab"

<em><strong>Happy Halloween!</strong></em> We hope you enjoyed putting together costumes, carving pumpkins and resisting (or not) the temptation to eat the Trick-or-Treat candy! We are looking forward to another fantastic Hacker Scouts Open Lab this Sunday 11/4 from 2-5pm.

First the bad news: it looks like our supplies for Spy Gadgets may have fallen off the container ship. Literally. So we are having to push Spy Gadgets again, which was frustrating for us- mostly because we know there are kids really looking forward to this project. We looked at getting the parts domestically, but it more than doubles our materials price, which we are trying to avoid. We are very cost conscious of the price of our kits and sensitive to the fact that many families must budget these kind of extra activities. So we have come up with an alternative, which is the good news....

<strong>Here's the line-up for this Sunday's Open Lab:</strong>

<strong>Featured project: Electro-Magnetic Levitation Devices! (2 Part Project) $5</strong>              In this first part, we will be building the electro-magnets and testing them out on different materials. In part 2 at the next HS, we will be building the levitation platform and making items hover in mid-air!

<strong>Wooden Archery Bows:</strong> Make your own bow and arrows out of reclaimed wood blinds and become the mighty archer you know you are.(Free)

Strong and flexible, they have a long range!<p></p></div>

<strong>LED Candles:</strong> Make your own LED candle to light up your holidays! No soldering required. ($2)

The Instructable for making the LED candles at home can be found <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/blog/2012/11/25/led-laser-cut-candle/">here</a>.

<strong>Laser Cut Lanterns:</strong>There will be a limited amount of these gorgeous lanterns for those who didn't get a chance to do them last time. ($5)

Prepayment will be available again! How it will work: If your child knows he/she wants a Electro-Magnetic Kit, you can Paypal us $16 (includes a transaction fee) to paypal@estrider.com. Please include your name and child's name in the notes section. Once we have your payment, we will reserve a kit for you. When you come to Hacker Scouts on 11/4 it will be available for you to simply pick up. No waiting required! If we sell out out of kits before Sunday, we will send out an email to the announce list. Note: there are <em><strong>no refunds</strong></em>. If your kit is not picked up by 3pm on Sunday, we will consider your purchase a generous donation to our Scholarship Fund and release the kit for sale to another family.

See you Sunday!

<strong>11/4 Follow up:</strong>

Thanks to everyone who came for another fun Sunday Open Lab! While Sam was out sick, her boys took over teaching the reclaimed blinds Bow project- which turned out to be the most popular activity. The halls were lined with young archers trying their hand at hitting various targets! There were also many requests to do this project again, so we will be offering it again to those who missed it.

We will be continuing the project of Electro-Magnets by making levitation devices. Nothing like seeing an object hover to inspire imagination and awe!

Finally, we will have all the information for the weekly Hacker Scouts Troop on our website by this weekend.

As always, if you have any questions or comments please contact us!
