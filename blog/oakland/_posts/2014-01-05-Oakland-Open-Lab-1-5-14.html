<h2>Oakland Open Lab 1/5/14</h2><h2>2-5pm at the Curiosity Hacked Oakland Lab</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Featured projects:</h3><h3><img src='/media/Blog/amplifier.jpg' height='480' width='360'>&nbsp; &nbsp;Cigar Box Amplifier (Two Session project!)</h3><p><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">T</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">oday&#39;s Oakland Open Lab electronics project: Building an amplifier (basically an mp3 speaker, small size and big sound). This is a bit harder than our kits because we&#39;re using a &quot;protoboard&quot;, which means you have to know how the components connect together -- but we&#39;ll have excellent instructions along with mentoring, and anyone familiar with soldering should find it easy. At the NEXT Open Lab we&#39;ll be building awesome cigar-box enclosures for our amp circuits! $15 includes BOTH Sessions (1/5 and 1/19)</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><img src='/media/Blog/needlefelting.jpg' height='360' width='480'>&nbsp; &nbsp;Needle Felting</h3><p>We are bringing back the popular needle felting class! Learn how to sculpt wool into characters and creatures using natural wool and special needles. Explore different techniques to get the effects and features you want! Special note: this requires good hand-eye coordination and we are using VERY sharp barbed needles. Younger kids need to have a parent helping them. $5 material fee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>We also have soldering kits, new t-shirts, and new badges in stock! See you at Open Lab!</h3><p>&nbsp;</p>
