title: "12/2 Open Lab: DIY Brush Bots!"
---
Holiday Greetings! We can hardly believe it is December already!

<strong>12/2 Open Lab Menu:</strong>

<div style="width: 309px;float:right;"><a href="/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/MSBB-8T_0.jpg"><img src='/media/Blog/MSBB-8T.jpg' height='299' width='300'></a> DIY Brush Bots<p></p></div>

<strong>Featured project: DIY Brush Bots and Habitats</strong>

I know a lot of kids (and parents) will be excited about this one! We will be building our own Brush Bots (like the popular Hex Bugs) and then creating habitats and/or mazes for them to move through with reclaimed materials. These are easy to make and fun to watch as they scurry around! $5

<strong>Art: Linocut</strong>

Linocut is a printmaking technique, a variation on woodblock printing. Learn how to transfer an image onto a block, carving techniques, and printing. Kit includes everything you need to learn plus go home and create your own masterful prints: Carving tool, paper, ink, brayer, 4 blocks. A great value at $19/kit. Please bring images (around 4x6) you would like to work with (we will also have some on hand).
