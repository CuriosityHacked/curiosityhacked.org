<strong>Hello from Hacker Scouts! </strong>

<strong>Below you will find information on our upcoming 10/21 Open Lab:</strong>

<a href="/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/trebuchet_kit_large_2.jpg"><img src='/media/Blog/trebuchet_kit_large_2-300x171.jpg' height='300' width='171'></a>Our featured project will be <strong>Trebuchets</strong>. These high quality kits are amazing! Note: while we try to keep all featured projects under $10, this one is an exception. The company we ordered from gave us an great deal, but the cost will be $20 and we have 25 of them.This time we are trying something new: pre-payment. We hope this will help reduce the payment line on Sunday as well as the possible disappointment when we sell out. How it will work: If your child knows he/she wants a Trebuchet Kit, you can Paypal us $21 (includes a transaction fee) to paypal@estrider.com. Please include your name and child's name in the notes section. Once we have your payment, we will reserve a kit for you. When you come to Hacker Scouts on 10/21 it will be available for you to simply pick up. No waiting required! If we sell out out of kits before Sunday, we will send out an email to the announce list. Note: there are no refunds. If your kit is not picked up by 3pm on Sunday, we will consider your purchase a generous donation to our Scholarship Fund and release the kit for sale to another family.

<strong>As always, kids are welcome to bring their own project to work on and/or get help with at any Open Lab.</strong>

Also, we will be unveiling our badge program at this Open Lab! We have Hacker
Scout badges being made right now, and will have a selection on hand for
kids to choose from such as “Learn To Solder” and Drawdio.” What, you might
ask, do we put the badges on? Well, you could put them on a hat or a
backpack! OR you could purchase one of our stylish canvas tool belts that a
focus group of Hacker Scouts selected as the most awesome and useful thing
to put their badges on ever. We will explain how the badge system works to the kids as well as post all of the information here on the website. That way kids can have time at home to analyze their goals and which badges they might want to work on. Some are for completing a kit, and others (like the soldering kit) will require a process of exhibiting skill, knowledge retention, and application. They may also request badges if there is a particular skill they want to work on. I have already heard from a few kids who would like to design some badges!

Finally, we encourage you to let us know if there are ever any kits or
activities that you would like to see Hacker Scouts offer. We get a great
discount at many online sources (that we pass along to you!) and have a
fantastic variety of skills among our mentors, and we are always looking to
serve our fellow Hacker families better. Please remember that this is a free program- any material fees charged only cover what it cost us to purchase those kits/supplies. Thanks for all your support and encouragement as we build this beautiful community!

Cheers, Chris, Sam, and all the mentors who volunteer their time for the love of Making
