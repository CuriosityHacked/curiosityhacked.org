<p><a href="/sites/default/files/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_2590.jpg"><img src='/media/Blog/IMG_2590-300x225.jpg' height='300' width='225'></a>As most of you know, we are starting a Hacker Scouts Guild at AMT. It was always a part of our vision to have a weekly group that could not only form community and learn together, but expand their individual skills and passions through long term, regular meetings. Where Open Lab is autonomous and small project oriented, the Guild is about consistency and goal setting. Monday night we had an information night with over a dozen families who believe in STEAM education and were enthusiastic about the possibilities of the Guild. Thank you so much for joining us in exploring this new adventure- especially in a holiday week! Our Guild leader will be <a href="http://hackerscouts.acemonstertoys.org/?page_id=5">Garratt Gallagher</a>, who is an excellent mentor, roboticist, Eagle Scout, and human. He has been involved as a mentor for Hacker Scouts from the beginning and is dedicated to our vision of accessible STEAM education, personal development, and building community for Maker families. We have posted a slide and notes show of Garratt&#39;s presentation<a href="http://www.hacker-scouts.org/index.php/78-hacker-scouts-guild/guild-events/73-parent-orientation" target="_blank"> here</a>. A registration form for interested families can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/estrider.com/spreadsheet/viewform?fromEmail=true&amp;formkey=dEVKVmFwcTgwUWVFejE5TVJ4S01JZkE6MQ">here</a>. Our next Guild Meeting will be Monday 11/26/12 at 6:30pm for an orientation meeting with the kids. Please note that the Guild is for children ages 8 and up only (any younger must approved by our Guild Leader). Any parents interested in more information on mentoring HS Guild should contact us. &nbsp;Email us with any questions! &nbsp;</p>
