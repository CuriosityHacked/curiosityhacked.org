Since we have a lot of new Hacker Scouts coming to Open Lab, and we are starting another season, we thought now was the perfect time! In this workshop, you will learn how to solder and get familiarized with many of the components you may come across when working with electronics. This will be an excellent activity for any kid wanting to move on to some of our more complex kits. ($10 materials fee includes intro kit, limit 20)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>[[{"fid":"674","view_mode":"teaser","type":"media","attributes":{"height":220,"width":155,"alt":"Air Rocket ","title":"Make Magazine Air Rocket Project","class":"media-element file-teaser"}}]]&nbsp;Compressed Air Rockets:</h3><p>Everyone loves this project, and we are bringing it back before the wind and rain begins and we won&#39;t be able to offer it for a while!
