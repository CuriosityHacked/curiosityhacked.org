## Thank you for your interest in the Curiosity Hacked Oakland Lab (CHOL).

Our Oakland location serves as our headquarters as well as our test bed for many of our programs. Guilds currently run four nights a week and Open Labs occur ever Sunday from 2-5pm. Other classes and after school activites run as scheduled.
