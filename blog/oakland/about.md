Our Oakland location serves as our headquarters as well as our test bed for many of our programs. Guilds currently run four nights a week and Open Labs occur ever Sunday from 2-5pm. Other classes and after school activites run as scheduled.<img src="/media/10632620_897683933593731_8723575834852983001_n.jpg" height='350px'/>
