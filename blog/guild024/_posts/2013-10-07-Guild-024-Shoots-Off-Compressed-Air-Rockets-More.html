title: "Guild 024 Shoots Off Compressed Air Rockets, More"

<p>Here&#39;s the younger sibling of a Hacker Scout at our Rocket Launch day. &nbsp;We built the compressed air rocket based on the instructions from MAKEzine, though we built ours in steel instead of plastic. &nbsp;The rocket is launched by pulling a strong, which is nice and long, for safety.</p><p>There&#39;s a crazy long hose (about ten feet) that leads to a bicycle pump for pumping air into the chamber. &nbsp;It was lots of fun! &nbsp;We made our rockets using vey thin cardboard (think cereal box) and duct tape. &nbsp;One Hacker Scout made some experimental rockets out of plain printer paper and masking tape, to see what would happen. &nbsp;</p><p>Here are a few more pictures of things we&#39;ve done:</p><p><img src='/media/Blog/HackerScoutscatapult1.jpg' height='320' width='240'></p><p>Building catapults of our own design using popsicle sticks and rubber bands.</p><p><img src='/media/Blog/HackerScoutcatapult2.jpg' height='240' width='320'></p><p>Testing another catapult of an original design.</p><p><img src='/media/Blog/HackerScoutgiantbubbles.jpg' height='277' width='320'></p><p>Blowing giant bubbles at the park! &nbsp;Yay for glycerine and humid days!</p>
