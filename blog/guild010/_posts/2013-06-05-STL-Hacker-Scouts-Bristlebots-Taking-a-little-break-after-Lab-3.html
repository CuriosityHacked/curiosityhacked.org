title: "STL Hacker Scouts | Bristlebots: Taking a little break after Lab #3"
---
<p>The scouts were busying completing Lab #3 along with the help of the mentors and the scouts that were already through with the lab #3 challenges. And as they completed, they got to have a little diversionary fun by building a Bristlebot from toothbrushes and pager motors. They engaged in sumo-style bot battles and even created a tournament bracket on the whiteboard and declared a champion! it was loads of fun and the kids got to take home their bot to further customize it for future tournaments.&nbsp;</p><p>You can see a short video montage of a few of the &quot;battles&quot; here:&nbsp;http://youtu.be/qdKPHnf-f5I</p><p>More photos and better video to come.&nbsp;</p>
