They also learned what to do in the event that the laser sharks or laser cats get out of hand. &nbsp;The kids are truly prepared. &nbsp;They had a big surprise when they saw a special video message from&nbsp;<a data-mce-="" href="http://www.jeremyblum.com" target="_blank">Jeremy Blum</a>&nbsp;(whose&nbsp;<a data-mce-="" href="https://www.youtube.com/course?list=ECA567CE235D39FA84" target="_blank">tutorial videos</a>&nbsp;the kids are watching as part of the curriculum that Roger and the other mentors are creating) just for them. Roger then took them on a tour of the facility, and on to the uControl&nbsp;Hacker Space, where they got their Hacker kits. Wow, they were thrilled!

Everyone completed the first lab with flying colors. They all got their lab signed off by a mentor and earned their first Knatom. &nbsp;The older kids were so enthusiastic they went straight on and started Lab 2, which they will continue at home.</p><p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; ">The mentors and helpers did a fantastic job and as a result this&nbsp;morning we have facebook posts all over saying how the kids are&nbsp;<a data-mce-="" href="http://www.stlhackerscouts.org/hello-world/" target="_blank" title="Welcome">Hacker Scout</a>&nbsp;Crazy and already back to work on the Lab 2 stuff at home.
