<h2>Does it get any better??? I think not!</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was a sunny perfect day on Downtown San Jose. We arrived around 12:30 to get set up, our fearless mentors showed up with their families at 1:30. At 1:45 the place was swarmed with families, curious, anxious and dying to get through the line to choose their projects. Wait a minute... we don&#39;t open until 2pm!!!!! I had a line that ran out the door from 1:45 to 4:15p. It was madness in the most perfect way.</p><p>[[{"fid":"652","view_mode":"full","type":"media","attributes":{"height":360,"width":480,"class":"media-element file-full"}}]]</p><p>This was our test. This was a crap shoot. We ordered in hopes of 20 to 30 families but ended with around 60-70. It is clear to us that SouthBay is ready for what we want to bring. There is an overwhelming need/desire for Hacker Scouts. I witnessed some of the most beautiful &quot;Ah Ha&quot; moments from both children and adults.&nbsp;</p><p>[[{"fid":"653","view_mode":"full","type":"media","attributes":{"height":480,"width":360,"class":"media-element file-full"}}]]</p><p>You see, I have been asked over and over lately &quot;Why are you doing this with your already packed schedule.&quot;</p><p>I came from a household who</p><p>1. didn&#39;t have the income to support my dreams of digging deeper into Science, Art and Technology.&nbsp;</p><p>2. My parents were either too overwhelmed to handle the commitment or saw sports as the only real outlet to &quot;success&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To make this short, I want to ensure that other kids get the opportunities that I didn&#39;t have. I want children to dream and be a vessel to make those dreams come true.&nbsp;</p><p>Who will be our next Steve Jobs, Einstein, Tesla or Gates?</p><p>I&#39;ll tell you who... these kids. &nbsp;Why, because of you all. Those of you who gave up your day to mentor. Those of you who gave up your day to bring your kids to explore.</p><p>[[{"fid":"651","view_mode":"full","type":"media","attributes":{"height":480,"width":360,"class":"media-element file-full"}}]]</p><p>The air was thick with Solder fumes and creativity.... My goodness it was spectacular.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We took notes on things we can do differently next time, we are trying to perfect the unknown so please know that we thank you for your support and we are working around the clock to make things better each time. Our next Open lab will be July 13, Saturday. We are trying to see which day (Sat or Sun) works best for the &nbsp;San Jose community.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Until next time... How can you hack your world to make change????</p><p>Mel&lt;3</p><p>I can&#39;t speak for Kandy but I am sure she feels the exact same way. &nbsp;</p><p><span class="bqQuoteLink" style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; line-height: 26px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/i/isaacasimo109758.html" style="color: rgb(0, 51, 153) !important; text-decoration: none;" title="view quote">The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not &#39;Eureka!&#39; but &#39;That&#39;s funny...&#39;</a></span><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;" /><span class="bodybold" style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;"><a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/i/isaacasimo109758.html" style="color: rgb(0, 51, 153) !important; text-decoration: none;" title="view quote">Isaac Asimov</a></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">&nbsp;</span><br />&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
