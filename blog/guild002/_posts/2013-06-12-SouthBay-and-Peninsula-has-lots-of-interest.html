<p>What a beautiful problem to have. Over 80 kids on our interest list want to become Hacker Scouts. Without leaders and mentors this program cannot function. Please consider leading a guild to alleviate some of the wait list. If you joined us on Sunday you saw firsthand how many people want to be a part of this amazing program.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, it requires time but the pay off is huge....</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are interested please email us directly at guild002@hacker-scouts.org</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
