The lobby is to remain clear for Tech Shop members and their visitors. &nbsp;Children cannot run around, lie down or play on the displayed artwork in the lobby. This is not a drop off program, the adult is to remain within a reasonable distance of their children. Mentors and leaders cannot babysit or watch over your children. They are extremely busy working with the kids on projects. Please review these expectations with your family so there is a clear understanding. And thank you for your on going support.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Menu of projects</u></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[[{"fid":"707","view_mode":"full","type":"media","attributes":{"height":300,"width":297,"style":"width: 175px; height: 177px;","class":"media-element file-full"}}]]&nbsp;&nbsp;<u><strong>Brush Bots $3.00 Materials Donation&nbsp;</strong></u></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;">Teach kids about making, working with basic electronics, and thinking outside the box in minimalist &quot;robot&quot; design with the MAKE BrushBot Kit.&nbsp;Inspired by the original Bristlebot how-to from our friends at Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories, the BrushBot uses the head of a toothbrush as its body and the bristles as its legs. The hundreds of nylon hairs twitch and vibrate to make the &quot;bot&quot; bounce along like a nervous little insect. A tiny pager motor and coin cell battery provide the get up and go. The kit comes with the parts you need to build 4 of your own BrushBots. They&#39;re easy to make, fun to personalize, and good, goofy fun to race.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[[{"fid":"674","view_mode":"full","type":"media","attributes":{"height":480,"width":339,"style":"width: 150px; height: 212px;","alt":"Air Rocket ","title":"Make Magazine Air Rocket Project","class":"media-element file-full"}}]]&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><u>Compressed Air Rockets $3.00</u></strong><u><strong>Materials Donation&nbsp;</strong></u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'PT Sans', 'Trebuchet MS', HelveticaNeue, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 25px;">These are super popular and fun!
