title: "Ithaca Hacker Scouts"
---
<p>A dozen kids, a lot of LEDs, some soldering irons, and a generous helping of enthusiasm have meant that the new Ithaca, NY Hacker Scouts guild is off to a great start! Mentors Claire and Yamila got things started in June with a Hydraulic Judobots Open Lab session. After a brief discussion of how hydraulics work, the kids launched into designing and making the bases of their bots. By the end of the two hour session, everyone had a fully-functioning Judobot and it was time to test them out. It was really fun and interesting to see how different bases added to (or detracted from!) the stability of individual bots, and I think that everyone went home glowing with pride and excitement about having successfully created something so cool in such a short session.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[[{"fid":"692","view_mode":"full","type":"media","attributes":{"height":230,"width":308,"class":"media-element file-full"}}]]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [[{"fid":"689","view_mode":"full","type":"media","attributes":{"height":231,"width":308,"class":"media-element file-full"}}]]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The next week, our members started by working on their LED badge. They&#39;ve learned about Ohm&#39;s Law and the basics of an electrical circuit. LED Poi were a huge hit. <span class="fbPhotosPhotoCaption" data-ft="{&quot;type&quot;:45}" id="fbPhotoSnowliftCaption" tabindex="0"><span class="hasCaption">Hacker scouts soldered 5 LED&#39;s into a star shape, nestled them in bubble wrap inside of a trimmed down 1-L bottle with a 9 volt for weight and power, added some string and duct tape handles and were ready to spin some light.</span></span> Luckily the space we&#39;re using had a big, dark room! It was also really cool to spin them outside after dark.
