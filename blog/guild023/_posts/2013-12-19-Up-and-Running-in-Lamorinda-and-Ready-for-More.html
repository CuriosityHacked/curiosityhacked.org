<p>Thank you to all of the parents in Lafayette, Moraga, and Orinda, CA who have helped us get started. He have had 6 meetings so far and are excited to start our Hackerling Circuits in the new year. We&#39;ve been busy learning to solder, learning about components on circuit boards, and learning about what it means to be in our guild. It&#39;s been a great experience. We are currently full with a pretty substantial waiting list. If you would like to get on the waiting list, please fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HTNt4hynexu69CHFZ1i8r40Xtfe6fKFNcw7m9GB9lN8/viewform">registration form</a>.</p><p>If there are other parents who would like to lead a second guild in Lamorinda, we probably have the interest and could share supplies, curriculum, etc. Email me with any questions: guild023@hacker-scouts.org.</p><p>Rob</p>
