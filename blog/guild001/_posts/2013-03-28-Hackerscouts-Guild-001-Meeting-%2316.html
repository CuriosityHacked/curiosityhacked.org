title: "Hackerscouts Guild 001 Meeting #16"
---
<h2>Guild 001 Trashes a Flat Screen!</h2><p>Our scouts had another great hacking experience this meeting, and for some of the scouts, their first foray into hacking by taking apart a huge flat screen TV! &nbsp;They had a blast taking this apart to find multiple circuit boards and interesting components. &nbsp;They enjoyed it so much, they didn&#39;t want to stop and some of the scouts were asking if they could keep some of the parts! &nbsp;Hackerscouts is holding onto the circuit boards for more hands on learning later on. &nbsp;One wanted the glass front, but it was decided by her parents it was best not to bring it home, because it was pretty thin and could break. &nbsp;However, one teenage scout took the screen part home to test what lightning will do to it.&nbsp; You can learn a lot by taking apart electronics that are no longer useful and finding new uses for the components.</p><h2>[[{"fid":"395","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"399","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"400","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"401","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]</h2><p>[[{"fid":"404","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"405","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"402","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"403","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]</p><h2>Guild 001 Making Friends</h2><p>This meeting&#39;s focus was making friends and using our Creativity. &nbsp;Garratt separated the scouts into various small groups mixed with First Wave Scouts and Second Wave Scouts, with the purpose of inclusion in mind. &nbsp;These groups will foster not only friendships, but teamwork, and collaboration. &nbsp;These groups came up with their own names like Doctor Wolf and 4.</p><p>[[{"fid":"406","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"407","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"408","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"410","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]</p><h2>First Wave Scouts Learn About Hacking</h2><p>[[{"fid":"417","view_mode":"full","type":"media","attributes":{"height":360,"width":480,"style":"font-size: 12px; width: 280px; height: 188px;","class":"media-element file-full"}}]]&nbsp;&nbsp;Our new scouts continued soldering components on the test circuit and taking other non-working electronics apart.</p><p>[[{"fid":"411","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"415","view_mode":"teaser","type":"media","attributes":{"height":165,"width":220,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-teaser"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"419","view_mode":"teaser","type":"media","attributes":{"height":165,"width":220,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-teaser"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"420","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]</p><h2>Second Wave Scouts</h2><p>Work continues in badge groups. &nbsp;T<span style="font-size: 12px;">here wasn&#39;t much time left over since most of the meeting was devoted to taking apart the TV, those few who need to finish their Hackerling Circuits will work next meeting to finish up.</span><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span></p><p>[[{"fid":"421","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"416","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"414","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"413","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]</p>
