<h2>What&#39;s Happening in Guild 001?</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Our Second Wave Scouts Join The Guild!</h3><p>This meeting marked the day when Hackerscouts Guild 001 finally is complete! &nbsp;Our second wave of scouts joined us! &nbsp;Garratt led the Opening Discussion with an Introduction game. &nbsp;Each scout said the name of the scout before them and the superpower they wished to possess, then they shared their own name and their superpower. &nbsp;Some of the superpowers were to fly, mindreading, transfiguration, and to make silence! &nbsp;This game gave them a chance to get to know each other a little and serves to break the ice! &nbsp;The scouts really enjoyed the game! &nbsp;We weren&#39;t sure what it was going to be like with all those scouts in one room, but everything went smoothly!</p><p><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1119.JPG' height='220' width='165'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1121.JPG' height='220' width='165'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1125.JPG' height='220' width='165'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1126.JPG' height='220' width='165'></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1129.JPG' height='480' width='360'></p><h2>First Wave Scouts Mentor New Members</h2><p>Garratt paired off the new scouts each with a First Wave Scout. &nbsp;Each First Wave scout&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12px;">gave the new scouts an overview of the Hackerling Circuit and the Badge tree. &nbsp;They&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12px;">shared their progress on their circuit, showed them their enclosures, and leather&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12px;">pouches. &nbsp;They shared stories, and made friends. &nbsp;The new scouts were very attentive&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12px;">and this iintroduction to the circuit building process reallly helped them to get comfortable.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1130.JPG' height='220' width='165'><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1132.JPG' height='220' width='165'><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1135.JPG' height='220' width='165'><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1137.JPG' height='220' width='165'></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1138.JPG' height='480' width='360'></p><h2>The Votes Are In! &nbsp;The First Ever Hackerscouts Guild Leader Is....</h2><p>The First Wave held the first ever election of the Guild Leader position, and Asst. Guild Leader. &nbsp;It was very impressive to see how much the scouts prepared for their campaign and how well they understood the responsibilities. &nbsp;It was great to see Seven scouts campaign for this coveted position. Most ran on the &quot;responsible, on time, and good behavior&quot; ticket. &nbsp;Some just talked about how awesome they were! &nbsp;And they were ALL awesome! &nbsp;All the scouts had multiple votes and it was very close. &nbsp;The Guild Leader position went to Skyler and Assistant Leader was a tie with Jamel and Miranda. &nbsp;They will equally share the responsibilities. &nbsp;The Hackerscouts Guild Leader is an important role and carries a lot of responsibility. &nbsp;They must be on time for meetings, call meetings to order, run the opening and closing, and meet with adult leaders to plan activities. &nbsp;They must also be a positive role model of behavior for the other scouts. &nbsp;They all learned public speaking skills and about the democratic process.</p><p><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1146.JPG' height='220' width='165'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1148.JPG' height='220' width='165'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1150.JPG' height='220' width='165'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1152.JPG' height='220' width='165'></p><p><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1153.JPG' height='220' width='165'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1155.JPG' height='220' width='165'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1157.JPG' height='220' width='165'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1205.JPG' height='220' width='165'></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1167.JPG' height='165' width='220'></p><h2>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Second Wave Begins Solder Practice!</h2><p><br /><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1183.JPG' height='480' width='360'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1187.JPG' height='220' width='165'><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1165.JPG' height='220' width='165'><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>First Wave Begin Badge Groups!</h2><p><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1175.JPG' height='220' width='165'><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1180.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1181.JPG' height='220' width='165'></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1198.JPG' height='480' width='360'></h2><h2>&nbsp; Finishing Up the Leather Pouches</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1200.JPG' height='220' width='165'>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1163-001.JPG' height='220' width='166'></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1196.JPG' height='480' width='360'></p><h2>&nbsp; Closing Circle: &nbsp;Creativity Lesson</h2><p>Our new Guild Leader Skyler held the maraca as he led the closing circle for the first time. &nbsp;Samantha led a fun discussion by asking the scouts some questions and they had to use their imagination and creativity to come up with possibilities. &nbsp;One question she asked was, &quot; How would a hat work if it were a laptop?&quot; &nbsp;The scouts came up with all kinds of ideas, some of them were a robot arm that would type for you, a mindreading hat that could know what you wanted it to do by telepathy, and a helmet with a visor that was a computer screen. &nbsp;Samantha asked them what a gorilla would look like if it were magnified 1000 times and one scout said their hair would look like trees. &nbsp;Then she asked what could you do with a gorilla that was shrunk down, and the responses were use it as a ball, <font face="arial, sans-serif" size="2">teach it to massage, and train them to play minecraft. &nbsp;This was a great closing circle and all the kids really enjoyed it!</font></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1194.JPG' height='220' width='165'>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1190.JPG' height='220' width='165'><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1193.JPG' height='220' width='165'></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
