<h2>Hackerling Circuit Progress</h2><p><br />The cows came home at Hackerscouts tonight....Garratt brought in what appeared to be the hides of more than one cow, because the Hackerscouts started the final step in the Hackerling circuit!&nbsp; They have started making their leather Hackerling circuit pouches! &nbsp;Tonight we had a visiting leather making expert, Justin, who gave some tips to our hackerscouts and demonstrated making a beautiful leather satchel.&nbsp; He helped us all with some great tips and how-tos.&nbsp; A few of the scouts learned about leather stitching techniques, and they are fired up to do it themselves, we are so ready to start constructing them next week!&nbsp; Some of the scouts were working on their Inkscape design, and many scouts were finishing up their enclosures.&nbsp; Quite a few were crowded around the laser cutter as it sliced through the thin wood they are using for their enclosures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src='/media/Blog/Hackerscouts learning from the leather expert, Justin' height='220' width='165'>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP0763lowres.jpg' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp; <img src='/media/Blog/Stiching lessons' height='180' width='180'></center><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Resourcefulness and Persistence Lesson #4: &nbsp;Toxic Waste Removal</h2><h2><img src='/media/Blog/Toxic Waste Removal' height='400' width='300'></h2><p>Samantha led a really great activity with the kids about persistence and resourcefulness.&nbsp; The kids had to empty out a bucket of &quot;toxic waste&quot;&nbsp; (ping pong balls) without touching the waste, using skewers, cds, tape, and various other items.&nbsp; They then had to carry the waste to another bucket.&nbsp; It was pandemonium at times, but we were able to catch the hackerscouts being very persistent and resourceful!&nbsp; The bucket was emptied, the other filled, and the scouts had another meaningful learning experience.</p><p><img src='/media/Blog/Persistence' height='220' width='176'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/Persistence 2' height='180' width='180'></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>What are the teens up to?<img src='/media/Blog/Cam and Jamel constructing an enclosure for the Nintenduino' height='400' width='300'></h2><p>One of the teens brought his Nintenduino to share with the guild, and worked on an enclosure for the screen with help from another teen.&nbsp; Some of the teens hung out in the laser cutting room while Shoshana cut out the leather for the hackerling pouches. &nbsp;They enjoyed hanging out together and had fun getting a little silly! &nbsp;They have completed their circuits and enclosures and next will be making their leather pouches!</p><p><img src='/media/Blog/Shoshana and teen members' height='220' width='165'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/Jamel eating over the toxic waste' height='180' width='180'></p>
