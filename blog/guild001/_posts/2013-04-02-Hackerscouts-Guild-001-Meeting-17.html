<h2><span style="font-size: 12px;">Second Wave Begin Hackerling Circuit</span></h2><p>This was a pretty exciting meeting for the Second Wave Scouts! &nbsp;They began soldering components on the Hackerling Circuit! &nbsp;It was great to see them dive in and get to work, and they made a great start! &nbsp;They are taking their time, learning the fundamentals of soldering, and what the components are all for. &nbsp;They learned about the arduino micro processor, and what the accelerometer circuit is. &nbsp;They are learning the concepts of circuitry while working on soldering the components one at a time to make sure they know what it is they are soldering, as well as making sure each component goes in the right place.</p><p><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1759.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1768.JPG' height='180' width='180'><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1790.JPG' height='180' width='180'><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1791.JPG' height='180' width='180'></p><p><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1771.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1772.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1781.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1784.JPG' height='180' width='180'></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Zombies, Gummy Bears, Wolves, and Hamsters, OH MY!<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1715.JPG' height='480' width='360'></h2><p>The meeting started off with the different groups getting together to plan their group logo. &nbsp;There were spikes, hamsters, TARDISes, wolves, and many more cool designs drawn tonight. &nbsp;The energy in the room was palpable as their creative minds went to work. &nbsp;All were drawing their ideas, then they collaborated together to come up with a final design. &nbsp;The scouts will work further next meeting to simplify their designs so that patches can be made. &nbsp;The groups are called The Iron Winged Hamsters, Zombie Gummy Bears of Doom, Tech Gods, Crew 4, and Doctor Wolves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1703.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1720cropped.jpg' height='180' width='180'><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1707.JPG' height='180' width='180'><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1723.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1708.JPG' height='180' width='180'><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1718.JPG' height='180' width='180'><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1716.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1728cropped.jpg' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1705.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1710.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1729.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1737.JPG' height='180' width='180'></h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>First Wave Scouts Make Progress in Badge Groups</h2><p><span style="font-size: 12px;">In the LED group, one scout </span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">finished wiring his laser eye-beam headpiece. &nbsp;It has two batteries, two LEDS and a switch. &nbsp;All that&#39;s left is a little sewing to make it more wearable. &nbsp;Another scout&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">planned out a design for his &quot;Pi counter&quot;, it will be an LED matrix that calculates and displays all the digits of pi. &nbsp;He began collecting parts for that this week, and he will start the project next week.</span></p><p><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1750.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1797.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1761.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1794.JPG' height='180' width='180'></p><p><br /><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1792cropped.jpg' height='388' width='254'><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.333333969116211px;">The programming group continued reviewing data types with an understanding of memory consumption.
