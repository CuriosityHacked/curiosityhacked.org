&nbsp;Some were practical, some not so, and some downright scary! &nbsp;Using metal mesh as a loofah sponge, ouch! &nbsp;But, they also came up with some ingenious ways to use the myriad of objects he brought. &nbsp;A roll of tubular metal screening became a pasta strainer and a wheel! &nbsp;One of the teen Hackerscouts, Cameron Mira found an actual use for it, he is going to use it to shield cables from high voltage!</p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'PT Sans', 'Trebuchet MS', HelveticaNeue, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 25px;">&nbsp;</p><center>[[{"fid":"315","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]<span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>[[{"fid":"302","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]<span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>[[{"fid":"303","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]<span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></center><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>Hackerling Circuit Progress</strong></h2><p>[[{"fid":"304","view_mode":"full","type":"media","attributes":{"height":360,"width":480,"style":"width: 300px; height: 225px; float: right;","class":"media-element file-full"}}]]<br />We are all headed to the finish line on the Hackerling Circuit! &nbsp;Many of the scouts started stitching their pouches, and some are almost done! &nbsp;They riveted their loops on with brass rivets and pounded in their snaps! &nbsp;The scouts are using a lock stitch for strength and durability. &nbsp;A few are still working on their enclosures and will soon be done!

&nbsp;A project that involved soldering components, programming circuits, Computer aided design, laser cutting, construction of enclosure, leather working, textiles, stitching and riveting! &nbsp;The scouts had to troubleshoot and use their resourcefulness, persistence, and creativity all along the way.</p><p>[[{"fid":"306","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"width: 170px; height: 170px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[[{"fid":"308","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"width: 170px; height: 170px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[{"fid":"314","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"width: 170px; height: 170px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]</p><center><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Creativity Activity</h2><p>[[{"fid":"309","view_mode":"full","type":"media","attributes":{"height":360,"width":480,"style":"width: 250px; height: 206px; float: right;","class":"media-element file-full"}}]]</p></center><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Samantha led the scouts in a Creativity activity where they had to ask their partner questions about their life and they had to draw images to represent what their partner described to them. &nbsp;They were not allowed to use numbers or letters. &nbsp;For example, when they asked how old they are, some wrote down dots to represent the years, some drew dominoes. &nbsp;Some of the things they drew were pictures of family cars, siblings, and parents. &nbsp;The scouts had to be descriptive, and the one drawing had to use their creativity to make visual representations of the information that was given to them. &nbsp;This was challenging for them since they are used to being asked to describe things with words. &nbsp;It was a great activity for the scouts to get to know each other better, and for them to use their thought processes in a different way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><center><p>[[{"fid":"311","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[{"fid":"310","view_mode":"full","type":"media","attributes":{"height":360,"width":480,"style":"width: 220px; height: 165px;","class":"media-element file-full"}}]]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[{"fid":"313","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"width: 180px; height: 180px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]</p></center><p>&nbsp;</p>
