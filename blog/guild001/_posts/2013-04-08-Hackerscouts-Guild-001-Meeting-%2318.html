<h2>Crew Logos</h2><p>The meeting started out with the individual crews breaking out and working on their Crew Patch designs. &nbsp;Many honed in on what was essential in their designs and we saw some great drawing. &nbsp;We had a name change with one of the groups, they felt Techno Gods was not quite what they wanted, so they are now the Technomancers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[[{"fid":"475","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"476","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"477","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"480","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]][[{"fid":"483","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"481","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]<span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span>[[{"fid":"478","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]<span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span>[[{"fid":"482","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]<span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Second Wave Scouts[[{"fid":"484","view_mode":"full","type":"media","attributes":{"height":360,"width":480,"style":"font-size: 12px;

font-size: 13px;">Together they worked on breadboards, powering the different leads of an RGB (3-lead common cathode) LED, as well as turning on the segments of a 7-segment LED display. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 13px;

scale didn&#39;t necessarily mean they had a true scale diagram that they could send to the laser cutter. &nbsp;So those on this step had to re-size several diagrams in order to get the dimensions matching the real world scale they want. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Some of the projects they are working on include a desk, a lightbox, and a model plane. &nbsp;These three are the furthest along and will likely be cutting prototypes using the lasercutter on Monday. &nbsp;Another scout&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">is designing a doll house, she has nice scale sketches done, and began designing in Inkscape. &nbsp;One scout&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">is planning a 3D model of a bear, another is designing a model train, while another is planning a rubber band gun.</span></p><div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;

&nbsp;The crew Doctor Wolves came up with, &quot;If you resolder this, it might work better.&quot; &nbsp;The crew formerly known as The Tech Gods, who will now be known as the Technomancers, came up with, &quot;That&#39;s a really nice drawing, but it would be better if it didn&#39;t look so much like a face.&quot;&nbsp;</p><h3 style="margin-left: 280px;">Snack Time at Hackerscouts Guild 001</h3><p>&nbsp;
