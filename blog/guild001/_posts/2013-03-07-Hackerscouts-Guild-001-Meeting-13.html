&nbsp;Some were practical, some not so, and some downright scary! &nbsp;Using metal mesh as a loofah sponge, ouch! &nbsp;But, they also came up with some ingenious ways to use the myriad of objects he brought. &nbsp;A roll of tubular metal screening became a pasta strainer and a wheel! &nbsp;One of the teen Hackerscouts, Cameron Mira found an actual use for it, he is going to use it to shield cables from high voltage!</p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'PT Sans', 'Trebuchet MS', HelveticaNeue, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 17px; line-height: 25px;">&nbsp;</p><center><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP0880.JPG' height='180' width='180'><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP0866.JPG' height='180' width='180'><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP0881.JPG' height='180' width='180'><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></center><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong>Hackerling Circuit Progress</strong></h2><p><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP0869.JPG' height='480' width='360'><br />We are all headed to the finish line on the Hackerling Circuit! &nbsp;Many of the scouts started stitching their pouches, and some are almost done! &nbsp;They riveted their loops on with brass rivets and pounded in their snaps! &nbsp;The scouts are using a lock stitch for strength and durability. &nbsp;A few are still working on their enclosures and will soon be done! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP0870.JPG' height='180' width='180'></p><p>What an experience this has been for our Hackerscouts! &nbsp;A project that involved soldering components, programming circuits, Computer aided design, laser cutting, construction of enclosure, leather working, textiles, stitching and riveting! &nbsp;The scouts had to troubleshoot and use their resourcefulness, persistence, and creativity all along the way.</p><p><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP0871.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP0874.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP0875.JPG' height='180' width='180'></p><center><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Creativity Activity</h2><p><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP0894.JPG' height='480' width='360'></p></center><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Samantha led the scouts in a Creativity activity where they had to ask their partner questions about their life and they had to draw images to represent what their partner described to them. &nbsp;They were not allowed to use numbers or letters. &nbsp;For example, when they asked how old they are, some wrote down dots to represent the years, some drew dominoes. &nbsp;Some of the things they drew were pictures of family cars, siblings, and parents. &nbsp;The scouts had to be descriptive, and the one drawing had to use their creativity to make visual representations of the information that was given to them. &nbsp;This was challenging for them since they are used to being asked to describe things with words. &nbsp;It was a great activity for the scouts to get to know each other better, and for them to use their thought processes in a different way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><center><p><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP0882.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP0878.JPG' height='480' width='360'>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP0892.JPG' height='180' width='180'></p></center><p>&nbsp;</p>
