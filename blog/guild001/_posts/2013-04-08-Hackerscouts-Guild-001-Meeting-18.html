<h2>Crew Logos</h2><p>The meeting started out with the individual crews breaking out and working on their Crew Patch designs. &nbsp;Many honed in on what was essential in their designs and we saw some great drawing. &nbsp;We had a name change with one of the groups, they felt Techno Gods was not quite what they wanted, so they are now the Technomancers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1913.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1916.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1912.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1918.JPG' height='180' width='180'><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1924.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1921.JPG' height='180' width='180'><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1915.JPG' height='180' width='180'><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1923.JPG' height='180' width='180'><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Second Wave Scouts<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1925.JPG' height='480' width='360'></h2><p>The Second Wave continued work on the Hackerling Circuit. &nbsp;The scouts watched a&nbsp;<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">soldering video, which explains a lot about the soldering process. &nbsp;They worked on&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12px;">soldering on the ICs and the headers, a few got to solder on resistors.</span></p><p><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1927.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1928.JPG' height='180' width='180'></p><p><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1929.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1932.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1937.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1938.JPG' height='180' width='180'></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>First Wave Scouts</h2><p>The First Wave Scouts continued work in their badge groups</p><h3>In the LED Group</h3><p>One scout was designing his Pi Counter, he made a drawing of the design and&nbsp;<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">used&nbsp;</span><a href="http://boxmaker.rahulbotics.com/" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);" target="_blank">boxmaker.rahulbotics.com</a><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;to design a lasercut enclosure for his Pi clock, and we cut out the prototype in cardboard.</span><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp; Another scout finished his Laser Eyes Project, he just needs an elastic band to hold it on his head, and he began designing an LED light saber. &nbsp;They drew a design on paper and then used the computer design program to further their ideas. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Together they worked on breadboards, powering the different leads of an RGB (3-lead common cathode) LED, as well as turning on the segments of a 7-segment LED display. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Glenn brought in his giant LED baton and we discussed the merits of PVC pipe vs. lasercut acrylic.</span></p><p><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1926.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1942.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1939.JPG' height='180' width='180'><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1941.JPG' height='180' width='180'><span style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</span></p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Programming Group Works on learning the fundamentals of coding.</h3><p>&nbsp;

font-size: 13px;">The 2D-3D Group&nbsp;</span><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1945.JPG' height='480' width='360'></h3><p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Kids continue to work on their designs. &nbsp;Everyone has a project design started but are in various degrees of completion. &nbsp;They are using their drawing skills, Inkscape design skills, and learning the 3D printer. &nbsp;Last week they were planning parts, identifying material and sizing their designs. &nbsp;This past Monday, they were bringing these initial paper sketches into the digital realm by creating scale diagrams in Inkscape. &nbsp;They did a good job of doing the diagrams but quickly learned &quot;eyeballing&quot; scale didn&#39;t necessarily mean they had a true scale diagram that they could send to the laser cutter. &nbsp;So those on this step had to re-size several diagrams in order to get the dimensions matching the real world scale they want. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Some of the projects they are working on include a desk, a lightbox, and a model plane. &nbsp;These three are the furthest along and will likely be cutting prototypes using the lasercutter on Monday. &nbsp;Another scout&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">is designing a doll house, she has nice scale sketches done, and began designing in Inkscape. &nbsp;One scout&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">is planning a 3D model of a bear, another is designing a model train, while another is planning a rubber band gun.</span></p><div style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;

font-size: 12px;">Tonight we had an Open Sourcing session and a few of the scouts shared their projects they have been working on. &nbsp;One scout shared his computer game he programmed using Scratch. &nbsp;The game is called The Hunger Games Survival Mode. &nbsp;He told the scouts all about how he designed it and the obstacles he had to overcome.</span></div><p><img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1949.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1951.JPG' height='180' width='180'>&nbsp;<img src='/media/Blog/IMGP1952.JPG' height='480' width='360'></p><h2><span style="font-size: 12px;">Core Value: &nbsp;Positive Attitude</span></h2><p>The scouts discussed the Core Value of having a Positive Attitude tonight. &nbsp;The scouts broke into crews and discussed how they could critique someone&#39;s project in a positive way. &nbsp;Garratt asked them, &quot;How could you tell someone that something isn&#39;t working right in a positive way?&quot; &nbsp;The crew Doctor Wolves came up with, &quot;If you resolder this, it might work better.&quot; &nbsp;The crew formerly known as The Tech Gods, who will now be known as the Technomancers, came up with, &quot;That&#39;s a really nice drawing, but it would be better if it didn&#39;t look so much like a face.&quot;&nbsp;</p><h3 style="margin-left: 280px;">Snack Time at Hackerscouts Guild 001</h3><p>&nbsp;
