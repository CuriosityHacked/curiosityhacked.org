<h2>What&#39;s Happening in Guild 001?</h2><p>The scouts got straight to work this meeting, with the First Wave Scouts heading into their Badge Groups and the Second Wave scouts straight to work on their Hackerling Circuits. &nbsp;It was a busy and productive night, the room was abuzz with the sounds of the next generation of hackers being raised! &nbsp;It is an awesome sound to hear all these kids having such meaningful learning experiences!</p><h2>First Wave Scouts:</h2><h2>[[{"fid":"517","view_mode":"full","type":"media","attributes":{"height":373,"width":280,"style":"font-size: 12px;

The leader of the LED badge group, Shoshana Abrass said, &quot;The lightsaber handle is made from PVC. &nbsp;</span></font><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">We had virtually all the parts needed to assemble his lightsaber. &nbsp;He used sugru to attach the PVC pipe to the handle, and more sugru to make the handle grips. &nbsp; We experimented with the EL wire to see whether one, two, or three strands would work best. &nbsp;Finally we had to take apart the EL wire battery box, file down the handle and use a Dremel cutting tool to make everything fit inside the handle. &nbsp;The last thing we&#39;re missing is a switch to turn it on/off from the outside. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">He also had time to make a simple design in Inkscape and cut a pendant out of acrylic.&quot;</span></p><p>[[{"fid":"513","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"514","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"515","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"516","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"527","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"528","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h2><span style="font-size: 12px;">Computer Programming</span></h2><p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Programming is moving along well...The scouts have functioning Arduino software on their laptops, they ran a successful &#39;Hello World&#39; program on their boards, and started converting the pseudo-code for the Make Change program to run on the Arduinos.</span></p><h2>&nbsp;

font-size: 13px;">One scout made progress on his scale design but is still finishing his Inkscape step. &nbsp;Another finished her scale digital design for two parts of the doll house. &nbsp;She was able to cut her first prototype on the laser. &nbsp;She learned the slots in her design were much too big, not just for the cardboard but for her final plywood design as well. &nbsp;Next week we should see more scouts making their first cuts.</span></p><p>[[{"fid":"522","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"523","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"524","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]&nbsp;[[{"fid":"525","view_mode":"preview","type":"media","attributes":{"height":180,"width":180,"style":"font-size: 12px;","class":"media-element file-preview"}}]]</p><div><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Second Wave Scouts[[{"fid":"534","view_mode":"full","type":"media","attributes":{"height":360,"width":480,"style":"font-size: 12px;

font-size: 13px;">&quot;Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will.&quot;</b><span style="color: rgb(55, 55, 55); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;">&nbsp;This was&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12px;">to show that negative emotions can be damaging, and that positive thoughts could help in a crisis. &nbsp;Garratt asked the groups to split up and come up with a positive response to a crisis. &nbsp;When discussing what the doctor would do in a crisis, the Doctor Wolves crew replied, &quot;He would keep everyone calm.&quot; &nbsp;The Zombie Gummy Bears Crew were discussing what a positive response would be to a Minecraft crisis, like squid taking over the earth. &nbsp;One of the scouts said, &quot;Calm down and use the magic of the butter sword to blow it up.&quot; &nbsp;The Fantastic Doctors Crew said, &quot;Just be calm.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
