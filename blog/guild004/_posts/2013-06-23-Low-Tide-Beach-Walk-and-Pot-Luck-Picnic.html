This is a casual event and opportunity for us to meet and get to know each other.<br /><br />To find us, park in the most Northerly parking spot you can find, and head north, towards the wetlands trail at the very end of the parking lot. Once you cross over, there is long stretch of beach that is excellent for viewing low-tide animals, and it&rsquo;s much less crowded than the main beach. We won&rsquo;t be using the picnic facilities at the park.<br /><br />We will be gathering around 10:30 and will have a Hacker Scouts banner and a table to put food and snacks on. We are planning to meet up with the naturalist around noon for the salmon talk.<br /><br />You can see a layout of the park and trails here: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.seattle.gov%2F%2Fparks%2Fenvironment%2Ftrails%2Fimages%2Fgolden_gardens.gif&amp;h=PAQFDVJgt&amp;s=1" rel="nofollow nofollow" target="_blank"><span>http://www.seattle.gov//</span><wbr /><span>parks/environment/trails/</span><wbr />images/golden_gardens.gif</a></span></span></span><br /><br />&nbsp;</p><p><span itemprop="description"><span class="fsl"><span class="text_exposed_show"><strong>Things to bring:</strong><br /><br />&middot; Food to share (or bring your own lunch&mdash;that&rsquo;s fine too!)<br /><br />&middot; Sunscreen<br /><br />&middot; A camera<br /><br />&middot; Waterproof shoes, boots or sandals if you like them<br /><br />&middot; Blanket or towels to sit on, camp chairs, etc.<br /><br />&middot; A pen or pencil to keep track of the critters you find on the beach-life scavenger hunt</span></span></span></p><p><br /><br /><span itemprop="description"><span class="fsl"><span class="text_exposed_show"><strong>Things to Leave at Home:</strong><br /><br />&middot; Your dog&mdash;dogs can wreck havoc on fragile creatures and sea grass during low tide, so please leave your furry people at home&mdash;thanks!<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.seattle.gov//parks/environment/trails/images/golden_gardens.gif" rel="nofollow nofollow" target="_blank"><span>http://www.seattle.gov//</span><wbr /><span>parks/environment/trails/</span><wbr />images/golden_gardens.gif</a><br /><br /><br /><br />The event will go on, rain or shine.
