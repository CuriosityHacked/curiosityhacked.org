## Open Lab Hightlights

Welcome to the new Guild 004 blog!  If you've been following our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/HackerScoutsSeattleGuild004), you know we've been busy holding Open Labs twice a month at [Metrix Create:Space](http://www.metrixcreatespace.com/),  meeting new friends at our local Seattle Mini Maker Faire, and having the occasional beach picnic. 

Before we begin listing new events, here's a quick look back at some of the highlights from the past few years. 

###Game Design
Most recently, [Pop-Up Science](http://www.pop-upscience.com/) led a workshop in game design, using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) from MIT.  The open lab was a big hit, and the kids were able to create versions of the classic game Pac Man, with their own unique touches.  

###Calder Inspired Kinetic Scultpure
We also made Calder-inspired kinetic sculptures with wire, found objects and cardboard.  Getting all of the elements to balance was a fun challenge.  We have worked with the artistic concept of "balance" before in two dimensions, but when making a mobile kinetic sculpture, it's a lot different when you have to balance the force of gravity, along with balancing the elements of your design.  Making a sculpture that looks simple, is not as easy as it sounds! The kids' originality and creativity was an inspiration.  

###Copy Paper Box Tornadoes 
This project came from the Science Bob website.
