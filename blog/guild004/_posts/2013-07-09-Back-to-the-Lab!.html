<p>We are back at Metrix Create:Space&nbsp; for Open Labs the 2nd and 4th Sunday of every month.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This Sunday, July 14th at 1:00pm</strong>, we&#39;ll be working on a group project--a compressed air rocket launcher.&nbsp; If you were at the Seattle Maker Faire, you may have seen one firing off paper rockets outside the venue.&nbsp; It looked so cool, we decided to build one of our own.&nbsp; Come on down to Metrix and lend a hand, and/or build your own rocket.&nbsp; If all goes well, we&#39;ll be trekking over to a local park to launch our rockets later in the afternoon.&nbsp;</p><p>More info and reservations on the <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/7404532155">Eventbrite Invite.</a>&nbsp; The Open Lab is free, but there&#39;s a suggested donation of $10 to cover expenses.&nbsp; Reservations will guarantee you a spot in case Metrix gets mobbed (again).&nbsp;</p><p>Hope to see you there!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
