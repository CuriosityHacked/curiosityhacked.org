<p>Hello and thank you for your interest in Curiosity Hacked! We started with a vision of bringing STEAM (science,
technology, engineering, art, and math) education to our community in a relevant and exciting way! We focus on real
skill building and a developmentally progressive structure to helps kids and families get the most out of Hacking and
Making.</p> <p>We were founded in Oakland, CA as a partner of Ace Monster Toys Hackerspace. We are a separate national
non-profit organization, however, operating under the fiscal umbrella of The School Factory. We offer three programs
that are designed to meet the needs of all ages, abilities, and interests. You can read more about Curiosity Hacked<a
href="openlab.html"> Open Lab</a>, <a href="guild.html">Guild</a>, and<a href="sparks.html"> Sparks</a> on our
website.</p> <p>We assist groups in forming new Curiosity Hacked locations, and we also keep a list of interested
families by area that we can connect to form new groups.</p> <p>For groups wanting to join our organization, we have
developed guidelines of benefits and expectations. To become a Curiosity Hacked Guild, potential leaders must meet,
either in person or via the Internet to go over our program, mission, and our agreement with a member of the Curiosity
Hacked staff. Once we have established that all parties would like to move forward, we ask that the potential leaders
&nbsp;sign an agreement committing to our mission statement and the terms laid out in our benefits and expectations.</p>
