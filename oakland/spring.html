<h4>Chemistry</h4>
</header>
<p>A proton and a neutron are walking down the street.</p>
<p>The proton says, "Wait, I dropped an electron help me look for it."</p>
<p>The neutron says "Are you sure?" The proton replies "I'm positive."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Would you like to understand why chemists find this joke hilarious but ultimately inaccurate? Join us for introduction to chemistry to find out! In our class we’ll dive deeply into the concepts of atomic structure, molecular bonding and polarity. We will engage in tests to compare the solubility of substances and discuss the ways matter is constantly interacting all around us. Selected readings will be provided as an introduction to the concept that will be covered in class. We will perform in class tests or experiments, with an optional writing portion for each experiment. This class will also integrate the CH Matter Badge, which includes objectives and projects that support a hands-on experience in understanding the fundamentals of Chemistry.</p>
