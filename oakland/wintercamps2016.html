<h2>Curiosity Hacked Winter Camps 2016</h2>
<blockquote>
CH Winter Camps are unique and extraordinary, maintaining the same level of learner centered mentorship and possibilities as our year-long programs. We keep the ratio small and the ideas big, presenting concepts and skills in a way that offers children the freedom to self-determine and make choices that stay true to their own vision. We also have expansive age ranges to intentionally encourage mixed age learning. We set the minimum age in anticipation of motor skills and understanding, and create more complex challenges and leadership opportunities for the older kids. If you feel your child is ready for a particular camp, or have questions regarding one of our camps, please contact us. We hope your child will join us!
