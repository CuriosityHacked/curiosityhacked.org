With knives we can create spears, atlatls, darts, throwing stars, and simple but effective traps and snares. Power tools offer us the ability to create wooden swords, axes, and shields. They aren't always pretty, but they are sturdy and fierce! The laser cutter utilizes more delicate wood, but allows for the creation of complex and fantastical weapon designs limited only by our imaginations. Children will also have the option to decorate and accessorize their weapons with paint, foam, leather, and more.",

The final six weeks will dive deeper into mentoring the kids in the areas of making that interest them most, resulting in a project of their own vision.
