<h2>Educator Summer Camps</h2>

The Curiosity Hacked Educator Summer Camp is a 3 day immersion in learner centered education. Presentations and discussions will be led by CH, as well as by guest speakers on the topics of creating a more learner centered environment. Integrating making and hacking with a variety of tools, technology, and materials to create a more interdisciplinary day will be covered in theory as well as hands on practice. Tools such as the soldering iron, 3D printer, laser cutter, E-textiles, printmaking and more will be explored and mentored, resulting in personal projects they can use to inspire their own innovation and creativity as well as that of their students.
Summer Camp will be led by Samantha Cook, Founder and ED of Curiosity Hacked, learning about creating/supporting a more learner-centered classroom environment through mentorship, hands-on making, and hacking to integrate skill building into existing curriculum. Participants will be gaining new skills, work with a variety of materials, and discuss relevant ideas and examples to enhance their own visions as well as those of their students. CH will offer a Professional Development certificate upon completion.

<h4>Feedback from past participants:</h4>
<blockquote>
"Best PD workshop ever!"

<blockquote>
" OMG!!!!!! Every day was an eye opening experience for me - - not to be afraid to try something - to take my curiosity to the next level - - and instead of focusing on the person next to me and comparing my output to theirs, to let MY creativity and MY curiosity lead me to MY path of making.I've cleaned out my garage space and am setting it up as a makerspace/hackerspace... with the objective of making it available to other educators for tinkering, making, sharing and learning.
Thank you SO much for offering this workshop!!"

"I loved everything! The hands on AND being able to choose what/how to do. To watch and learn from others in real time. To have conversations with colleagues in the field (guest speaker and other participants) about application, issues, challenges and ideas.  To learn from Sam how CH was developed and how it continues to evolve. I LOVED that I made my first bot!!"

<blockquote>
"I thought this workshop was a really great balance of perspective, vision-sharing and hands-on experience.  What was shared illustrated the power of creative problem-solving when motivated by tangible, learner-valued projects.  I am totally inspired to see the projects I do with kids differently and to guide them to see themselves as innovators, builders and thinkers.  Learning new skills and stretching myself creatively also helped me to reflect on my own learning/teaching style and fueled my excitement to do more!"
"In my opinion, the allotted time was well structured.  I especially appreciated Sam's examples of ways that she had used projects to spark and encourage social-emotional and academic growth in the kids.  The guest speakers provided a wider look at what was out in the community.  And the time for us to actually do projects and explore materials/techniques...well, there could never be too much time for that, right? "
