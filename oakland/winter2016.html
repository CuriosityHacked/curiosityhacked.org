<h4>Video Game Design and Development</h4>
</header>
Join mentor Cara for a 10 week exploration of character, environment, and gameplay design. Using
game development programs with simple and visual scripting, kids will build a solid foundation in
various aspects of game design and development while also building skills in their own areas of
interest.
<br>
<span class='italic'>Cara Ricci started playing video games in second grade and has been in love with the medium ever
since. She graduated with a degree in Game Design Art and hopes to inspire others to get into games as
well. She believes young people have some of the best game ideas but don’t always know how to
execute them—that’s where this class comes in! Her favorite series is Legend of Zelda and she enjoys
adventure, horror, and puzzle games.</span>
<br>Ages 11 and up

<h4>Intro to Minecraft Modding</h4>
</header>
Transform Minecraft into your canvas and paintbrush. You’ll learn the primary tools used by Minecraft
creators and Youtubers to create games, art, simulations, gadgets and more inside the world of
Minecraft.
<br>
You’ll be introduced to the basics of reprogramming Minecraft with modding using drag and drop
programming, but that’s just the beginning. WorldEdit is an existing mod that is like 3D Photoshop for
Minecraft, it lets you paint buildings into existence, then copy and paste them, or level whole areas.
CommandBlocks and Redstone are like ingame mods, that use the logic from programming and
electrical engineering to bring your visions to life.
<br>
Come learn to create your own games, art and more inside of Minecraft! Turn your favorite game into
your favorite creative tool, and learn the basic skills necessary to use more complex creative tools.
<br><span class='italic'>This class is powered by a collaberation between Curiosity Hacked and TechLX.</span>
<br>Ages 8 and up; You must have your own computer based Minecraft account. BYO Laptop, or use one of ours.
<span class='date'>Two times offered; Mondays 1pm-3pm or Fridays 4pm-6pm, $275</span>

<h4>Intro to Arduino Robotics</h4>
</header>
Learn the basics of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and programming. You’ll construct
a wheeled robot, wire up its motors and sensors, then bring it to life with code. Though rather than
focus in depth on the code, you will broadly learn the Arduino platform, working with existing code and
modifying it to do what you want.
<br>
The Arduino platform is like Lego Mindstorms with the plastic shells taken off. Instead of being limited
to Lego’s set of components, you can attach and wire up almost any electrical component you want.
Though you’ll have a specific set of parts for use in the class and competition, you can bring your own
components and if there’s time we’ll show you how to use them.
<br>
The course begins with the construction of your robot chassis. Then you attach and wire up the core
components. Finally you work from sample code to get the robot to do what you want. And finally
compete against your classmates in an autonomous robotics competition! Then take it home to
continue hacking at home.
<br><span class='italic'>This class is powered by a collaberation between Curiosity Hacked and TechLX.</span>
<br>Ages 8 and up, materials fee included ($60) - Kids keep their robot!

<h4>Making Through History: Ancients</h4>
</header>
Join us for an immersion of history, seen through the art, innovation, and inventions of the Ancient
World. Starting with Prehistory and working our way to the fall of Rome, we will research, explore,
recreate, build, and appreciate Ancient technology and aesthetics, while connecting Ancient design
and ingenuity to modern day influence and function. We will use quality materials and traditional
techniques to explore the ways cultures all over the world expressed and advanced themselves in
ancient times.
<br>
<span class='italic'>This class will be taught by mentor Samantha Cook, who is the founder of Curiosity Hacked and has
been teaching for over 20 years. She has an extensive background in history, humanities, art, and
making.</span> (Making Through History: Middle Ages will be offered Spring 2016)
<br>Ages 7 and up

<h4>Advanced Minecraft Modding</h4>
</header>
Take full control of Minecraft with a deep dive into Minecraft Modding. In this course we expect you
are already familiar with existing mods like WorldEdit, and how to use CommandBlocks and Redstone.
If you are ready to start creating your own mods, this is the course for you!
You’ll start modding with drag and drop programming, but move onto writing JavaScript code. Maybe
you’re thinking, “Hey! Minecraft’s written in Java not JavaScript.” You’re right! But there’s a
wonderful mod called ScriptCraft that let’s you write server mods in JavaScript. It also let’s you build
programmatically using invisible “drones” that do your bidding inside Minecraft.
<br>
Come learn game programming, by reprogramming your favorite sandbox game! You’ll host your own
CraftBukkit/Spigot Server, running ScriptCraft and WorldEdit, then write your own mods for it.
<br><span class='italic'>This class is powered by a collaberation between Curiosity Hacked and TechLX.</span>

<h4>Advanced Arduino Robotics</h4>
</header>
Learn to program robots while learning the basics of electrical and mechanical engineering! This course
assumes you have some experience with programming or robotics already, and dives deep into writing
code from scratch. At first you’ll work from sample code, then you’ll start creating entirely new
sections of code yourself!
<br>
You’ll build your robot on the Arduino electronics platform, which is a perfect step between Lego
Robotics and professional robotics. Instead of being limited to the Lego collection of electronics
components, you can wire up and program almost any electrical component using your Arduino.
<br>
First you’ll construct the chassis of your robot, then attach and wire up the motors and sensors. Finally
you’ll bring your robot to life with code, and prepare it to compete against your classmates’ robotic
minions! Then take it home to continue hacking at home.

<br>Ages 10 and up, materials fee included ($85) - Kids keep their robot!
