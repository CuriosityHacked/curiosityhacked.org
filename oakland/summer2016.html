<h2>Curiosity Hacked Summer Camps 2016</h2>
CH Summer Camps are unique and extraordinary, maintaining the same level of learner centered mentorship and possibilities as our year-long programs. We keep the ratio small and the ideas big, presenting concepts and skills in a way that offers children the freedom to self-determine and make choices that stay true to their own vision. We also have expansive age ranges to intentionally encourage mixed age learning. We set the minimum age in anticipation of motor skills and understanding, and create more complex challenges and leadership opportunities for the older kids. If you feel your child is ready for a particular camp, or have questions regarding one of our camps, please contact us. We hope your child will join us!

<h4>Feedback from some of last summer’s campers:</h4>
<blockquote>
“I especially like that this wasn’t a camp that you HAD to do something. We could design and build whatever we wanted and I knew the mentors would help me figure it out.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
“Hackwarts was really fun. The projects were awesome. I especially loved my wand, it made my spells magical.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
“I am coming back every year. And during the year. As much as I can.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
“My mentor showed me that my strengths and my challenges were all superpowers, and how I could use them to do anything.”

<h3>Curiosity Hacked Educator Workshop</h3>
<h4 style="padding-top: 0">June 13th - 15th or June 16th - June 19th 10am-3pm</h4>
<blockquote>
Curiosity Hacked Educator Summer Camp is a 3 day immersion in learner centered education. Presentations and discussions will be led by CH, as well as by guest speakers on the topics of creating a more learner centered environment. Integrating making and hacking with a variety of tools, technology, and materials to create a more interdisciplinary day will be covered in theory as well as hands on practice. Tools such as the soldering iron, 3D printer, laser cutter, E-textiles, printmaking and more will be explored and mentored, resulting in personal projects they can use to inspire their own innovation and creativity as well as that of their students.

<h3>2D to 3D Skill Building Hack</h3>
<h4 style="padding-top: 0">July 5th - July 8th (4 days) 9am-3pm</h4>
<blockquote>
In this camp, young hackers will become proficient in Inkscape and CAD as well as the elements of design, and then be able to accurately produce a 3D design that uses 2d parts, either on the laser cutter, 3D printer or another machine. This week is about how to make cool 3d stuff using 2d parts.  Kids will learn about making designs, choosing materials, joining parts (where your work first becomes 3D!) and fabrication. All kids will leave with a variety of projects and a badge! (ages 7 and up)
