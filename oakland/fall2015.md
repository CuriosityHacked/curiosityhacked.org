<h4>Video Game Design and Development</h4>
</header>
<p>Join mentor Cara for a 10 week exploration of character, environment, and gameplay design. Using
game development programs with simple and visual scripting, kids will build a solid foundation in 
various aspects of game design and development while also building skills in their own areas of 
interest.
<p>
Cara Ricci started playing video games in second grade and has been in love with the medium ever 
since. She graduated with a degree in Game Design Art and hopes to inspire others to get into games as 
well. She believes young people have some of the best game ideas but don’t always know how to 
execute them—that’s where this class comes in! Her favorite series is Legend of Zelda and she enjoys 
adventure, horror, and puzzle games.
